### Final Project : Pacman

This project consists of a pacman, in which it would be on a map where the balls that you have to eat would appear,
this would have difficulty since the ghosts would be present which would follow you around the map.

I use some libraries like conio.h because this allows me to use the arrows to move Pacman.

The reason that the program blinks its because the screen is constantly updating in order to offer a real-time gaming experience.
